# Ways of working

## Change process
1. Create branch based of main.
2. Implement code changes.
3. Create PR.
4. Have another person review it.
5. Reviewer should understand and have tested the code before approving.
6. Merge PR using "squash commits" option.

## Commit guidelines
* Keep commits small and concise.
* Try to have on change per PR working on 2 separate issues should be 2 seperate PRs.
* No reverts.
* If the branch has not been merged with main for a long time, then do a local merge before making a PR.
* If broadly spanding changes are required this needs to be aligned with the rest of the team.
