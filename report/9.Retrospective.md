# Lessons learned


## Biggest Issues
In the initial stages of the development, whole team was working on refactoring the old code into new one. This created multiple instances of merge conflicts, different coding approaches. 
Furthermore the group could have spend more time on dividing big tasks into smaller tasks, as to minimize merge conflicts and large pull requests. 
With each group member having varying schedules, knowledge sharing fast was at times an issue, but this was resolved by planning joint meetings between either the parties that held the knowledge and the ones who needed it, or with the entire group. 
## Reflection
In the initial stages of the project, the group had some difficulties finding eachother within the team. After multiple conflict-resolution meetings improvements were made // Delete this line if you think it's bad (i do)
After a while we managed to get a good communication flow and organized planning. Team members took tasks which they felt comfortable with but also wanted to gain new knowledge and improve. Code reviews were taken seriously which helped us to improve and reflect on the code before it was pushed into the main. Breaking down tasks and setting deadlines for them helped us to keep the whole project on track.
