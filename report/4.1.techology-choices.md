## Technology choices
### Programming Language
- **Choice:** GO
- **Considered:** Java, C#
- Compiles to a single binary which makes it easy to deploy
- Low memory consumption, runs well on slower VMs
- language forces proper error handling and safe code
- has detailed documentation 
### Software Artifacts
- **Choice:** Docker
- **Considered:** VMs, Linux Packages, LXC, Go Packages
- Lower overhead compared to VMs.
- Supported on most Linux distributions regardless of package managers.
- Containers isolate the environment from the host system.
- Support for using different language compared to language specific artifacts.
- Support micro-services in our case allow us to run API and app with Docker Compose.
- Community support.
### CI/CD Pipelines Tool
- **Choice:** GitHub Actions
- **Considered:** Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Bamboo
- Already integrated into code repository of our choice (Github).
- Minimal setup, compared to tools such as Jenkins.
- Runs on cloud without need of provisioning.
- Modern and easy to use UI.
- team members previous experience
### Artifact Registry
- **Choice:** GitHub Container Registry
- **Considered:** DockerHub, GitHub Packages
- We switched from DockerHub, because we were only able to use an individual DockerHub account unless we were willing to pay for an organization. 
- We chose GitHub Container Registry since it allowed us to publish container images directly in the GitHub organization. It also did not require us to use PATs since we could use the GITHUB_TOKEN from the action itself.
### Monitoring
- **Choice:** Loki, Promtail and Grafana
- **Considered:** ELK stack
- Loki has lower memory usage
- lightweight and easy to deploy
- easy to manage 
### Infrastructure Automation Platforms
- **Choice:** Terraform
- **Previously Used:** Vagrant
- There is currently larger community behind Terraform than Vagrant.
- Less unexpected behavior we experienced compared to using Vagrant.
