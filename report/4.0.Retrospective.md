# Lessons learned   

## Biggest Issues  
In the initial stages of the development, whole team was working on refactoring the old code into new one. At the early stages of the development we have decided to split the code bases into API section and web-app section. These 2 folders do share the code and need to be updated separately due to duplicity code. This proved to be an issue at later stages since we need to update both code bases with the same code twice.

Another issue which was found at the end stage of the development phase was slow data loading for the UI. Reason for this is not optimized query which was comparing each single message with the user ID to make connection. This should potentially be solved by using JOIN in the query and therefore makes the process much faster.


## Reflection  
The group could have spend more time on dividing big tasks into smaller tasks, as to minimize merge conflicts and large pull requests. With each group member having varying schedules, knowledge sharing fast was at times an issue, but this was resolved by planning joint meetings between either the parties that held the knowledge and the ones who needed it, or with the entire group.       

In the initial stages of the project, the group had some difficulties understanding each-other within the team. After multiple conflict-resolution meetings improvements were made. After a while we managed to get a good communication flow and organized planning. Team members took tasks which they felt comfortable with but also wanted to gain new knowledge and improve. Code reviews were taken seriously which helped us to improve and reflect on the code before it was pushed into the main. Breaking down tasks and setting deadlines for them helped us to keep the whole project on track.

Once the rules were set and understood by all members of the group, we were able to work more productively and efficiently.
