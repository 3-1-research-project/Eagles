# 2. Process' perspective

## CI-CD

### Pull request tests
When an issue is resolved and ready to be merged into main, a pull request is opened with the code changes. Automated testing using GitHub Action is started right after the pull request is created. In the meanwhile the pull request is available to be reviewed by a member of the project. The prerequisites for a pull request to be merged is passing all tests, passing the quality gate of the static analysis tool and having at least on approval. 

### Deployment
When the pull request is completed, the changed are merged to main triggering the ci-cd workflow with the following stages:
- Build docker image
- Push docker image to registry
- Deploy to K3S with Helm

### Other workflows
We have a few other workflows as part of our setup.
#### Automated releases
Minitwit is released  every Thursday at 21:50 using automated releases. The Github Actions finds the latest tag, increments it and creates new Github release. 

### Assign issues to project
To keep our opened issues up to date with our Kanban board, a Github Action periodically checks for new cards and automatically creates issues for them.

### Automated linting
There are three different linters each focusing on a different area of the codebase. Static analysis tool, docker files linter and source code checker. 

### Report PDF generation
Also as required there is a workflow for generating a PDF which takes all *.md* files using Pandoc from the report folder and combines them into a single file. 
### AI chat bots
AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Opus-3 were used during the development stage. These tools were useful in many different cases. Usage helped us solve the errors much faster by providing us with clarity of the error messages. Another benefits such as code refactoring, topic explanation, and providing us with new approaches/tool to implement for the given problem. Usage of LLMs sped up the work and saved us a lot of time.
